# Zephyr Cloud – Module Federation Attempt

## Overview

This repository contains my attempt to follow the official Zephyr Cloud tutorial for creating and deploying a Module Federation application:

https://docs.zephyr-cloud.io/tutorials/create-mf-app

The goal was to explore how Zephyr integrates with a Module Federation setup and understand the workflow beyond a standard React/Vite deployment.

---

## Setup Process Followed

Based strictly on the official tutorial, I performed the following steps:

1. Ran:

   npx create-mf-app

2. During the CLI setup:
   - Selected the desired framework and bundler.
   - The CLI prompted whether I wanted to add the Zephyr plugin.
   - I chose to include the Zephyr plugin directly during project creation.

3. Installed dependencies.
4. Attempted to run and build the project.

## Observations & Inconsistencies Found

While following the tutorial step by step, I encountered several inconsistencies between the documentation and the actual behavior of the tooling.

### 1. Zephyr Plugin Installation Flow Difference

The documentation states that after running `npx create-mf-app`, the Zephyr plugin should be installed manually for the selected bundler.

However, in the current CLI flow, `create-mf-app` already prompts to add the Zephyr plugin during project creation.

This suggests that:
- The documentation may not reflect the current CLI behavior.
- The installation step described in the tutorial may be outdated or redundant.

---

### 2. Missing Configuration Snippet in Documentation

In the section:

https://docs.zephyr-cloud.io/tutorials/create-mf-app#zephyr-configuration-integration

A configuration snippet expected to show how Zephyr integrates into the bundler configuration does not render properly in the documentation.

However, the `create-mf-app` command already generated a configuration file that includes Zephyr integration automatically.

This creates some ambiguity regarding:
- Whether manual configuration is still required.
- Or if the CLI fully handles Zephyr setup now.

---

### 3. Authentication Redirect to Localhost

When attempting to run or build the project, the CLI prompted authentication.

However, the login URL generated pointed to a localhost address that did not respond.

Observed behavior:
- Login link redirected to a local URL.
- No authentication flow completed.

This prevented completing the deployment flow for the Module Federation example.

This behavior differs from the previous React + Vite integration, where authentication and deployment worked seamlessly.

## Understanding of Zephyr in a Module Federation Context

Based on the tutorial and tooling behavior, my understanding is that:

- Zephyr integrates at the bundler level via a plugin.
- It detects Module Federation configuration.
- It extracts and uploads federated build artifacts.
- It handles remote hosting and distribution.

However, due to the inconsistencies described above, the full deployment flow for this specific MF setup could not be completed.

---

## Feedback

- The tutorial may need updating to reflect the current `create-mf-app` CLI behavior.
- The configuration snippet in the documentation should render correctly.
- The authentication redirect behavior should be clarified or corrected.
- It would be helpful if the documentation specified whether manual configuration is still required when the CLI auto-includes the Zephyr plugin.

## Final Notes

Despite the issues encountered, this exercise was useful in understanding how Zephyr aims to integrate with Module Federation at the bundler level.

The repository reflects the setup generated by the official CLI and the steps followed according to the documentation.
